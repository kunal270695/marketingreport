# Data-Driven Insights using Google Analytics and Looker Studio 


The focus of this article is to set up a web analytics framework for a newly built website. 
The goal is to support the business objective by leveraging web analytics. 
The website will be created using a website builder platform (weebly.com). 
GA4 will be used to monitor and report the key web metrics of the Google Merchandise Store for further shaping the marketing strategies. 
Moreover, Google Looker Studio will be used to create an interactive dashboard highlighting crucial metrics. 


Continuing your job as the Web Analyst for the Google Merchandise store, you have been assigned 
some new tasks of creating reports and dashboards for the Google Merchandise store. As part of 
your job role, you will need to build a dashboard for the marketing team. This will help the 
marketing team assess its performance thus, it will help them measure key performance indicators
while providing areas for optimisation in their marketing.
To accomplish this task, you have been asked to use Looker Studio for the development of a live 
reporting dashboard.

The key performance indicators you will need to create on your dashboard as suggested by the 
marketing manager are outlined below:
* General website traffic (website visits, visitors, and related metrics)
* Conversions (sales, revenue etc)
* The performance of digital marketing channels
* User engagement
* Demographic, geographic, and device statistics
* Add date range control so users can view performance based on date range

The marketing manager has also asked you to include an overview page in the dashboard with key 
data from the above outlined areas to give a quick snapshot of web performance.
You have free reign over design - the data and charts your dashboard contains should be chosen to 
best reflect the purpose of the dashboard and what you have been asked to include.
